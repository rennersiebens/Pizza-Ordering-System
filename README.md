# Pizza-Ordering-System

Object oriented Pizza ordering system. Using exception classes so the program does not crash. 
The program promts the user to choose an opperation to complete: Load order from file, save 
order to a file, add pizzas, remove pizzas, display order or quit. The application promts 
users to choose the size of their pizzas, toppings and how many they would like. The application
then prints out a cost for the pizzas once the user is finished. This was the original program 
for the Pizza Ordering GUI that I also made. Comments regarding how the program work can be found
in the source code.
